### Set Boundaries

The first step of shaping is setting boundaries of what you are trying to do. The conversation about building a feature always start with a `raw idea`. Before you start on the details of the feature, you need to define the broad terms of the discussion to make it productive.
<br/>

#### Setting the Appetite

You need to think if a feature is worth investing time into or not. How valuable is the idea worth? It helps to explicitly define how much time and attention the subject deserves.

- Is it worth a quick fix if time can be managed?
- Is it a big idea worth an entire cycle?
- Would you redesign what you already have to accomodate?
- Can it be considered if it can be implemented if it is a minor tweak?

This part is called the `appetite`. It's basically a time budget for a standard size team. Appetites are set for two sizes:

- `small batch`: a project that consists a team of one designer and one or two programmers that can be build within one or two weeks. You `batch` these together within a six week sprint cycle.
- `big batch`: a project that consists the same size team that takes the whole siz week sprint cycle.

If the scope is too big for a six week spring cycle, then you narrow it down to the problem definition. If that is not possible, then you break it down to the meaningful parts only that can fit within a six week sprint cycle.
<br/>

#### Fixed Time, Variable Scope

Appetite is different from an estimate. Estimate starts with a design and ends with a number. Appetite starts with a number and ends with an design. You use appetite as a creative constraint to the design process.

This principle is called **`fixed time, variable scope`**.

Without a fixed deadline to create pressure, you could not make trade-off decisions. Without a variable scope, you would include extra details that leaves no time to fix quality issues. This principle is applicable to each stage of the process - from shaping the project to building and shipping them.

**First, appetite constrains what kind of solution can be designed during the shaping process. Later, it is handed off to the team which a fixed time box pushes them to make decisions what is core to the project and what is peripheral or unnecessary.**
<br/>

#### "Good" Is Relative

The best solution is relatibve to your constraints. Without a time limit, there's always a better version. The amount of time set forth will lead to different solutions. Only you can judge a "good" solution based on the context of how much time you want to spend on it and how important it is.
<br/>

#### Responding To Raw Ideas

Your default response to any idea should be a soft "no" so it can leave all options open. **You don't need to put it in a backlog.** You give it time to figure out what's important and what it might entail.

> Don't make a commitment to something that you don't fully understand yet.

You need to work on the idea before it's shaped enough to submit resources to it. Don't shut down an idea that you don't understand. New information may come in that may lead to different ideas to work on.
<br/>

#### Narrow Down The Problem

Usually, you need to narrow down your understanding of the problem. Flip the question from "What could we build?" to "What is really going wrong?" **_You have to decide what is really driving that request._**

At what point specifically does someone’s current workflow break down without this thing they’re asking for?
<br/>

#### Case Study: Defining "Calendar"

In the calendar example, instead of asking the client **_WHY_** they want a calendar and what it should look like, we asked **_WHEN_** she needs a calendar. What was the client doing when this thought occured when asking for this?

This led to a solution that resolved around viewing open slots for scheduling for a specific day. **The insight wasn't "computerize the calendar". It was "seeing free spaces" that was the important use case and not "do everything a calendar does".**

This gave a specific `baseline` to design against. You now have a problem that was specific enough to spark an idea that could fit within an appetite. If you cannot figure out a specific use case, then your appetite should tell how much research is worth while to spend on. If it's not critical now then walk away and work on something else.
<br/>

#### Watch Out For Grab Bags

Redesigns and refactoring are the worst offenders for unclear ideas that are not driven by a single problem or use case. When someone proposes something big like "redesign for a particular feature section", that's a `grab bag` and not a project. It will be hard to figure out what it means, where it starts, and where it ends.

**Example of a proper starting point:**
We need to redesign the Files section because sharing multiple files takes too many steps.

This leads to questions like "What's not working? In what context are there too many steps? What parts of the existing feature can stay the same and what can be changed?

> Solving this issue can be broken down into smaller parts - better file previews, custom folder colors, etc. - which defines a single problem with clear expecations for a project.

<br/>

#### Boundaries In Place

When you have all three things - raw idea, an appetite, and a narrow problem definition - you can move to the next step to define the elements of a solution.
