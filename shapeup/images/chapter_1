### Introduction

The saying "execution is everything" is not quite true. Often times, it is actually quite wrong. Executing something wrong can have a deprecating effect on all things. So, you have a project done but at what cost?
<br/>

##### Six Week Cycles

Majority of new features should be built in six weeks. The idea is **moving the product forward in the next six weeks and not micromanaging time**. You don't need to count hours, question how the day is spent, or have daily meetings. And there is no need to rethink the roadmap every two weeks.

> You commit to the timeframe and get the work done.

##### Shaping the Work

Senior group will work parallel to the cycle with the team. They'll define the key elements of a solution before a project is considered to be ready. Its abstraction should be balanced - enough details so the team knows what to do, but abstract enough to work on the details themselves.

Focus less on estimates. Instead of asking how time it will **_take_** to do some work. Ask: "How much time do we want to **_spend_**? How much is this idea worth?

You are narrowing it down the problem and designing the outline of the solution that fits within the constraints of what you define.
<br/>

##### Making Teams Responsible

Give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers. They define their own taks, make adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices of the product one at a time.

This is building a virtuous circle. When teams are more autonomous, senior people spend less time managing them. With less time spent on managing, senior can shape up better projects. **When projects are shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomous**.
<br/>

##### Targeting Risks

At every step of the process, you must target a specific risk:

**_the risk of not shipping on time_**.

Improving your discovery process should come after after regaining your ability to ship. You reduce your risk in shaping the process by solving open questions before commiting the project to a time box.

> Never give a project to a team where it has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.

If a project runs over, by default it does not get an extension. This ensures that you don't invest multiple times of planning on a concept that needs rethinking.

And lastly, you reduce the risk in the building process by integrating design and programming early. Instead of building multiple disconnected parts and hope they fit together, you build a meaning piece of the work end-to-end early on and then repeat.
