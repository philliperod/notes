### How To Answer Estimation Questions

Tech companies are infamous for asking seemingly ridiculous “estimation questions,” also known as **Fermi Problems**. These questions are common in case interviews, software engineering interviews, and especially, product management interviews.

How is a PM interviewee supposed to answer this question? Are you expected to come up with a reasonable final number? Is there a particular strategy the interviewer is seeking? Below is a common structure that applies to most great estimation interview responses, as well as our three estimation question lessons.

#### 1. Memorize Basic Facts

It’s helpful to have these numbers in mind to bound your answer with reasonable estimates, and most of the time, these basic facts will help in your solution. Try to assess what industry the company works in and gather basic facts with numbers.

- US population: 330M
- California population: 40M
- NYC population: 8M
- World population: 7.8B
- Size of continental US: 3M square miles
- US households: 130M
- Average people per household in the US: 3
- Life expectancy: 72
- Median household income: $65,000
- Weight of an average car: 4000lbs

##### General sense of revenue (2020)

- Dropbox revenue: $2B
- Airbnb revenue: $3B
- Google revenue: $181B
- Facebook revenue: $86B
- Apple revenue: $274B
- Amazon revenue: $386B
- Netflix revenue: $25B
- Google (Alphabet) net income: $40.27 billion
- Apple R&D expenditure: $18.75 billion

##### General sense of user populations

- Netflix (Q2 2021): 209 million subscribers
- Google G Suite (March 2020): 2 billion+ monthly active users
- Uber (Jun 2021): ~1 million drivers in the US
- Twitter (Q1 2018): 192 million daily active users
- Number of Americans that own a smart speaker (Jan 2020): 60 million
- Number of products Amazon sells: over 12 million (not including Amazon marketplace sellers, which brings the total to 350 million)

Don’t over-memorize. You’ll just need to know a few basics to ground your answer. It’s not impressive for you to memorize the answers to all possible interview questions. This interview question tests how you think, not the final answer.

#### 2. Scope The Problems

Ask questions to clarify the scope of the problem in question.

Example: interviewer asks you to estimate the weight of a schoolbus.

- Does the weight estimate include a full tank of gas?
- Does the weight estimate include humans inside the schoolbus?
- How many people is the schoolbus expected to seat in total?

Interviewer may respond by telling you to make assumptions as needed.

#### 3. Break Down The Problem

It’s critical to explain your structure prior to answering. Specifically, how will you go about breaking down the problem into component pieces so that the problem becomes more tractable?

Example (cont. from above about the schoolbus): **_we isolate each component of a schoolbus and estimate its contribution to the overall weight._**

- Metal Exterior
- Engine
- Gas Tank (especially if full)
- Tires
- Interior (seats, driving wheel, etc.)
- External accessories (mirrors, lights, etc.)

Now that you've broken down the problem (and the schoolbus), you can estimate the individual weight of each piece.
