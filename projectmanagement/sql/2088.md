##### `theater_availability` table

##### `theater_seatmap` table

#### Understand the problem first

```
// Breakdown of problem

1. Find all adjacent seats
2. Check if left seat is available
3. Check if right seat is available
```

<br>

#### // Find all adjacent seats

You want to rearrange `theater_seatmap` table so you can visually see adjacent pairs.

```
select
        seat_left as left_seat,
        seat_number as center_seat,
        seat_right as right_seat
from theater_seatmap
```

![](images/2088_3.png)
<br>

```
select
        seat_left as left_seat,
        seat_number as right_seat
from theater_seatmap
union
select
        seat_number as left_seat,
        seat_right as right_seat
from theater_seatmap

-- using UNION clause to remove duplicate rows in result set by using seat_number column
-- combine left_seat to seat_number
-- combine right_seat to seat_number
-- now you have a more visual representation of pair seats
```

<br>

##### Additional Note

> **`UNION`** clause:
>
> combines the result set of two or more **`SELECT`** queries without returning duplicating values
> removing duplicates is similar to **`DISTINCT`**
> number and order of columns in both queries must be the same
> data types must be compatible
> to retain duplicate rows, use **`UNION ALL`**

<br>

Next, store query into an auxiliary statement or temp table using **`WITH`** clause.

```
with pair_seats as
    (select
        seat_left as left_seat,
        seat_number as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap
    union
    select
        seat_number as left_seat,
        seat_right as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap)

select * from pair_seats
```

#### // Check if left seat is available

Now, joining tables to check if the left seat is available.

```
with pair_seats as
    (select
        seat_left as left_seat,
        seat_number as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap
    union
    select
        seat_number as left_seat,
        seat_right as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap)

select *
from pair_seats ps
join theater_availability tal
    on tal.seat_number = ps.left_seat
where tal.is_available = 'TRUE'
```

![](images/2088_6.png)
<br>

Rather than showing all columns from both joined tables, show `pair_seats` table where 'TRUE' condition is applied to filter out results.

```
with pair_seats as
    (select
        seat_left as left_seat,
        seat_number as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap
    union
    select
        seat_number as left_seat,
        seat_right as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap)

select ps.*
from pair_seats ps
join theater_availability tal
    on tal.seat_number = ps.left_seat
where tal.is_available = 'TRUE'
```

<br>

---

#### // Check if right seat is available

```
with pair_seats as
    (select
        seat_left as left_seat,
        seat_number as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap
    union
    select
        seat_number as left_seat,
        seat_right as right_seat
    from theater_seatmap)

select ps.*
from pair_seats ps
join theater_availability tal
    on tal.seat_number = ps.left_seat
join theater_availability tar
    on tar.seat_number = ps.right_seat
where tal.is_available = 'TRUE'
    and tar.is_available = 'TRUE'

-- copying same JOIN statement for the right_seat
-- this is the correct solution; need premium to access solution for this problem
```
