### SQL

<br/>

##### What is SQL?

> Structured Query Language is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. Its database also provides a scalable storage for use like websites or apps.

##### What is Relational Database?

> Represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each table is similar to excel spreadsheets with a fixed number of columns (attributes or properties) and any number of rows of data.

Table example below:

| ID  | Type  | Make/Model     | # of Wheels | # of Doors |
| --- | ----- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1   | Sedan | Honda Accord   | 4           | 4          |
| 2   | SUV   | Audi Q8        | 4           | 4          |
| 3   | Sport | Tesla Roadster | 4           | 2          |
| 4   | Sedan | Tesla Model S  | 4           | 4          |

With a database like this, you might be a "related" table containing info about registered drivers in a state, types of driving licenses, or driving violations.

**Your goal in learning and using SQL is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data.** Questions like (from the example above with its related table) "How many types of vehicles only have 2 doors?", or "How many models do Tesla produce?", so it helps you make a better decision down the road.
