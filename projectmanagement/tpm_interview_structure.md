- Read the job description and reference it during the interview.
- Make sure you know what’s on your resume as it is common for the interviewer to ask about it.
- Do research on the company so that you can display why you’re interested in it.
- Look up the interviewer on LinkedIn so you can understand your interviewer a bit better; make references during the interview if you have something in common.

#### Tips:

- Look up every person you’ll be interviewing with and know something about them that you can reference during the interview.
- Have plenty of questions ready about the technology, the business, the team, career growth, and more.
- Write down and keep in mind answers to common behavioral questions such as the biggest failure you had or if you had to deal with difficult co-workers so that you bring up stories quickly.
- Do research on the company through Google, the company’s social media, and more; show passion and interest in the company by referencing your research.
- Use the product or service to test it out.
- Take hydration, fuel, and bio breaks as the on-site is an intense and long day where you could be talking for 6 or more hours.
- Imagine what kinds of questions they might ask depending on the company. (e.g. Lyft might ask you a transportation-based technical exercise).
- Email the recruiter after the interview thanking the team for their time.
