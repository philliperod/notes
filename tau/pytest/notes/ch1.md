### Chapter 1: Pytest

##### First Test Case

1. Python files are called modules because they contain code that is executed directly or imported by other files.
2. Pytest test cases are written as functions while other frameworks structure theirs as classes. This allows pytest test cases to be more simpler and concise.
3. Naming conventions are important to pytest. The prefix `test_` must be present in both modules and functions. The prefix `test_` for modules created a `_pycache_` folder once saved.
